# Security Policy for DeFi Wallet Tracker

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue, please report it immediately by emailing: neliedvine@live.com. We take vulnerabilities seriously and will work quickly to address any issues.

## Current Security Considerations

- **Alpha Stage:** This project is experimental and not intended for use with real funds.
- **Authentication:** There is currently no production-grade authentication or authorization.
- **Data Handling:** Input sanitization and validation are minimal at this stage.

## Planned Security Enhancements

- Implement HTTPS for secure data transmission.
- Add robust input validation and error handling on both frontend and backend.
- Integrate JWT-based authentication for secure user sessions.
- Regularly review dependencies and update vulnerable packages.
