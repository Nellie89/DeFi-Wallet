## 🛡️ Security Considerations

🚧 **This is an alpha-stage educational project. Do not use with real funds.**

Planned improvements:
- Use HTTPS for all backend/frontend communications
- Validate and sanitise inputs
- Integrate secure wallet data handling
- Add JWT-based authentication

## 🧠 Development Notes

This is a personal learning project exploring Web3 full-stack development. The goal is to eventually support basic DeFi portfolio tracking with wallet visualisation and investment summaries.
