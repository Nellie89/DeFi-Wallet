# DeFi Wallet

## Getting Started

### Install Dependencies

Ensure you have all the necessary dependencies installed. Run the following command in your project directory:

```sh
npm install
```

### Start the Express Server

Run the Express server using the following command:

```sh
npm start
```

This will start your server on the specified port (default is 3000).

### Set Up React Application

If you haven't already, set up a React application. You can use Create React App to quickly set up a new React project:

```sh
npx create-react-app my-defi-wallet
cd my-defi-wallet
```

### Add Your React Component

Copy the `MyComponent.js` or `MetaMaskConnector.js` file into the `src` directory of your React application.

### Use the Component in Your React App

Modify the `App.js` file in your React application to use the component. For example:

```javascript
// filepath: /c:/Users/nelli/DeFi Wallet/DeFi-Wallet/my-defi-wallet/src/App.js
import React from 'react';
import MetaMaskConnector from './MetaMaskConnector';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <MetaMaskConnector />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

### Run the React Application

Start your React application using the following command:

```sh
npm start
```

This will open your React application in the browser, and you should be able to see and interact with the MetaMask connector component.
